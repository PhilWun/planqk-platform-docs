Introduction
============

Welcome to the PlanQK Platform! PlanQK stands for platform and ecosystem for quantum-supported artificial intelligence and that basically says it all.

**Do you want to learn about quantum computing?**

The PlanQK community created a large set of knowledge artifacts, such as quantum algorithms including their executable implementations, solution patterns and use cases.
The platform enables you to browse through these artifacts, to add new ones and to discuss about them with experts from the quantum community.

**You already have running quantum algorithms and you want to make them easily accessible to your customers?**

The platform enables you to deploy them as services and to advertise them in a central service store.
The services provide standardized interfaces making it easy to integrate them into classical IT systems.

The platform features are described in detail under the following sections:
