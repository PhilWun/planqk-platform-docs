Welcome to the PlanQK Platform! PlanQK stands for platform and ecosystem for quantum-supported artificial intelligence and that basically says it all.

Do you want to learn more about quantum computing or exchange knowledge about it with experts from the quantum community?
The platform provides a variety of algorithms and use cases.

Do you already have running quantum algorithms, and you want to make them discoverable and easily accessible to your customers? Great!
The platform enables you to deploy them as services to advertise them in a central service store.
The services provide that can be called through standardized interfaces making it easy to integrate them with classical IT systems.
